PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Most systems struggle with accurately tracking orientation and motion in three dimensions in real time. We aim to create an affordable, portable solution that uses low-cost sensors and an OLED display to provide immediate feedback on position and orientation, useful for robotics, motion analysis, and wearable tech.
